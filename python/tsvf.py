Time-Symmetric Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF)

Implements retrocausal-inspired optimization for geometric factorization
and time-synchronized protocols. TSVF treats computational paths as 
dual-wave evolutions: forward from initial conditions (pre-selection) 
and backward from desired outcomes (post-selection).

Key Concepts:
- Forward wave: Evolution from initial state (semiprime candidates)
- Backward wave: Retrocausal constraint from validated factors
- Weak values: Enhanced by overlap of forward and backward states
- Time-symmetric metric: Incorporates both causal directions

Mathematical Framework:
- Forward state: |ψ_f⟩ evolving from t_initial → t_final
- Backward state: ⟨ψ_b| evolving from t_final → t_initial  
- Weak value: ⟨ψ_b|O|ψ_f⟩ / ⟨ψ_b|ψ_f⟩
- Time-symmetric distance: d_TSVF = α·d_forward + β·d_backward

This provides deterministic hindsight without violating causality,
enabling variance reduction and improved search guidance.

Axioms followed:
1. Empirical Validation First: Results reproducible with documented tests
2. Domain-Specific Forms: Z = A(B / c) applied to dual-wave evolution
3. Precision: mpmath with target < 1e-16
4. Causality: No information from true future, only constraint propagation
