# 256-Bit GVA Scaling Test Setup Documentation

## Overview
This document meticulously details the setup, execution, and results of the 256-bit scaling attempt for the Geodesic Validation Assault (GVA) factorization method. The goal was to empirically validate the hypothesis that GVA could factor at least one 256-bit balanced semiprime with ≤10,000 attempts, using unchanged logic except for increased attempt count.

## Hypothesis
**Claim**: GVA (unchanged except for 10,000 attempts) will factor ≥1 of 100 balanced 256-bit semiprimes.
**Status**: UNVERIFIED (no successes in attempted runs).

## Test Environment
- **OS**: macOS (via terminal simulation)
- **Python Version**: 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - sympy: For prime generation and primality testing
  - mpmath: For high-precision arithmetic (dps=50)
  - numpy: Not used directly
  - multiprocessing: Not used in this setup
- **Hardware**: Simulated CPU (no GPU acceleration)
- **Repository Branch**: feature/128bit-scaling
- **Commit Hash**: e8017f3 (latest after documentation)

## Code Components
### 1. Prime Generator: `generate_balanced_256bit_semiprime(seed)`
- **Purpose**: Generate balanced semiprimes N = p × q where p, q ∈ [2^127, 2^128), |log₂(p/q)| ≤ 1.
- **Algorithm**:
  - Set base = 2^127
  - offset1 = random.randint(0, 10^9)
  - p = sympy.nextprime(base + offset1)
  - offset2 = random.randint(1, 10^6)
  - q = sympy.nextprime(p + offset2)
  - N = p × q
- **Deterministic**: Uses seed for reproducibility (e.g., seed=0 for first N).
- **Balance Check**: Implicit via range; p and q close in value.
- **Example Output** (seed=0):
  - p = 170141183460469231731687303716790796823
  - q = 170141183460469231731687303716791201019
  - N = 28948022309329048855892746252480576725576023628096954646154136260124179562637 (255 bits)

### 2. GVA Core: `manifold_256bit.py`
- **Embedding**: `embed_torus_geodesic(n, dims=11)`
  - k = 0.3 / log₂(log₂(N+1)) (adaptive for scale)
  - Iterative: x = φ × (frac(x / φ))^k for 11 dimensions
- **Distance**: Riemannian on torus, κ = 4 × ln(N+1) / e²
- **Threshold**: ε = 0.2 / (1 + κ)
- **Search**: Brute force around √N with R = 10^7 (fixed for feasibility; theoretical max(10^7, √N / 1000) ~2^118, infeasible)
- **Precision**: mpmath.mp.dps = 50 (<1e-16 error target)

### 3. Test Harness: `test_gva_256.py`
- **Structure**:
  - num_tests = 100 (number of N's)
  - attempts_per_n = 100 (attempts per N, total 10,000)
- **Execution Loop**:
  - For each of 100 N's:
    - Generate N deterministically
    - For each of 100 attempts:
      - Run GVA with R=10^7
      - Check if factors found with dist < ε
      - If success, log and break for that N
- **Metrics Tracked**:
  - Success rate (% of N's factored)
  - Average time per attempt
  - False positive rate
  - Total attempts: 10,000

## Execution Details
### Command Run
```bash
python3 test_gva_256.py
```

### Sample Run (1 N, 1 attempt for testing)
- **Input**: seed=0
- **N**: 28948022309329048855892746252480576725576023628096954646154136260124179562637
- **R**: 10,000,000
- **Time**: 3.61 seconds
- **Result**: (None, None, None) — No factors found
- **Analysis**: R covers ~2×10^7 candidates around √N (~2^127), but N has ~2^255 bits, so probability ~10^-120 of hitting factors by chance.

### Full Run Feasibility
- **Estimated Time**: 10,000 attempts × 3.61s ≈ 36,100 seconds (~10 hours)
- **Expected Success**: 0 (brute force insufficient for 256-bit)
- **Actual Execution**: Not run in full due to time constraints; sample confirms infeasibility.

## Results and Validation
- **Success Rate**: 0% (0/1 sample; projected 0/100)
- **Time per Attempt**: ~3.61s
- **False Positives**: 0
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed seed=42 for full test set
- **Validation Against Criteria**:
  - [ ] Generate 100 verified 256-bit semiprimes: ✓ (code ready)
  - [ ] Update GVA to scale: ✓ (dims=11, adaptive k, dps=50)
  - [ ] Run 10,000 attempts: ✗ (infeasible with brute force)
  - [ ] ≥1 success: ✗ (0 successes)

## Files Modified/Created
- `test_gva_256.py`: New test harness
- `manifold_256bit.py`: Adapted GVA for 256-bit
- `GOAL.md`: Updated to UNVERIFIED
- `victory_256bit_attempt_1.txt`: Attempt log

## Limitations and Notes
- **Brute Force Bottleneck**: R=10^7 is tiny for 256-bit; true scaling requires A*/heuristic search.
- **Precision**: dps=50 ensures <1e-16 error, but not the limiting factor.
- **Balance**: Primes spread with offsets up to 10^9, avoiding trivial cases.
- **Future Optimization**: Integrate distance-sorted candidates or parallelization for feasibility.

## Conclusion
Test setup is meticulously documented for reproducibility. Hypothesis UNVERIFIED; GVA at current brute-force level does not scale to 256-bit. Next steps: Enhance search algorithm.
