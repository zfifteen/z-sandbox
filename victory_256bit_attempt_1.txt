# 256-Bit GVA Scaling Attempt Report

## Hypothesis
GVA can factor at least 1 of 100 balanced 256-bit semiprimes with <=10,000 attempts.

## Test Setup
- N generated: 28948022309329048855892746252480576725576023628096954646154136260124179562637 (255 bits)
- p: 170141183460469231731687303716790796823
- q: 170141183460469231731687303716791201019
- Attempts: 1 (sample)
- R: 10^7 (fixed for feasibility)
- Time: 3.61s
- Result: (None, None, None) - No factors found

## Analysis
- Brute force search with R=10^7 is insufficient for 256-bit N (sqrt(N) ~ 2^127, need R ~ 2^127 for coverage).
- Full 10,000 attempts would take ~10 hours, likely 0 successes.
- Hypothesis UNVERIFIED: GVA requires optimization beyond brute force for 256-bit.

## Next Steps
- Implement A* or advanced search for 256-bit scalability.
- Re-test with optimized R or geometry-guided heuristics.
