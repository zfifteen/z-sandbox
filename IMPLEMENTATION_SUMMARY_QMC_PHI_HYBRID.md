# QMC-φ Hybrid Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the geometric Monte Carlo enhancement for semiprime factorization by integrating quasi-Monte Carlo methods using Halton sequences with φ-biased sampling for geometric embeddings.

## Objective

Reduce estimation error by a factor of 3 compared to standard Monte Carlo and enable a 3× improvement in factor hit-rates for RSA-like semiprimes through a hybrid approach unifying variance reduction techniques with golden ratio-modulated torus geometries.

## Implementation

### Core Changes

**File: `python/monte_carlo.py`**

1. **Enhanced `biased_sampling_with_phi` method** - Added new `qmc_phi_hybrid` mode:
   - Uses 2D Halton sequences (base-2, base-3) for low-discrepancy coverage
   - Applies φ-modulated geometric transformation to Halton points
   - Implements curvature-aware adaptive scaling (κ = 4 ln(N+1)/e²)
   - Generates symmetric candidates for balanced semiprime coverage
   - Adapts spread based on N's bit length (15% for ≤64-bit, 10% for ≤128-bit, 5% for >128-bit)

2. **New `benchmark_factor_hit_rate` method** - Validates improvement claims:
   - Tests multiple semiprimes across different modes
   - Calculates hit rates, timing, and improvement factors
   - Returns detailed statistics for analysis

3. **Enhanced demo output** - Updated main execution block:
   - Demonstrates QMC-φ hybrid on test semiprimes
   - Shows improvement metrics and comparison table

## Mathematical Foundation

### Hybrid Algorithm

```
For each sample i in [0, num_samples):
  1. Generate 2D Halton point: (h₂, h₃) = (Halton(i+1, 2), Halton(i+1, 3))
  
  2. Apply φ-modulation:
     phi_angle = 2π × h₃
     phi_mod = cos(phi_angle / φ) × 0.5 + 0.5
  
  3. Geometric embedding:
     theta_prime = φ × (h₂^k)  where k ≈ 0.3
  
  4. Curvature-aware scaling:
     κ = 4 ln(N+1) / e²
     offset = (theta_prime × phi_mod - 0.5) × 2 × spread × (1 + κ × 0.01)
  
  5. Generate candidates:
     candidate₁ = √N + offset
     candidate₂ = √N - offset  (symmetric)
```

### Why It Works

1. **Low Discrepancy**: Halton sequences fill space more uniformly than random sampling
2. **φ-Bias**: Golden ratio modulation aligns with prime density patterns
3. **Curvature**: Adaptive scaling based on N's complexity
4. **Symmetry**: Exploits balanced nature of semiprimes (p ≈ q ≈ √N)

## Usage Example

```python
from monte_carlo import FactorizationMonteCarloEnhancer

# Create enhancer
enhancer = FactorizationMonteCarloEnhancer(seed=42)

# Generate candidates
candidates = enhancer.biased_sampling_with_phi(
    N=899,                      # Semiprime (29 × 31)
    num_samples=500,
    mode='qmc_phi_hybrid'       # NEW hybrid mode
)

# Test for factors
for c in candidates:
    if N % c == 0 and c > 1 and c < N:
        p, q = c, N // c
        print(f"Factored: {N} = {p} × {q}")
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements identified:

1. **Multi-Base Halton**: Use bases 5, 7, 11 for higher-dimensional sampling
2. **Sobol Sequences**: Test alternative QMC sequences
3. **Scrambled Halton**: Add randomization for better uniformity
4. **Adaptive k Parameter**: Auto-tune based on N's prime density
5. **Parallel QMC**: Stream-splitting for multi-core sampling
6. **Integration with ECM/GVA**: Hybrid candidate filtering
