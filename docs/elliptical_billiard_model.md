# Elliptical Billiard Model for Factorization

## Overview

The Elliptical Billiard Model is a novel approach to integer factorization that models the problem as **wavefront propagation on a curved manifold**. It leverages the geometric properties of ellipses in logarithmic space to identify factor candidates through self-interference patterns.

## Mathematical Framework

### Core Insight

For a semiprime N = p × q:

```
N = p × q
→ log(N) = log(p) + log(q)
```

In logarithmic space, N is the "sum" of two values at log(p) and log(q).

### Geometric Model: Clarification on Ellipse vs. Cassini Oval

**Important Note**: The relationship log(N) = log(p) + log(q) suggests a **sum of logarithmic distances**, which in classical geometry corresponds to an ellipse (constant sum of distances to foci). However, after exponentiation, this becomes a **product relationship**, which classically defines a Cassini oval (constant product of distances).

**Our Approach**: This implementation uses a **log-space ellipse approximation** for computational tractability. The model works in the log-transformed coordinate system where:

1. We embed values in log-space where the sum relationship holds naturally
2. The manifold curvature and metric are defined to preserve this log-space geometry
3. Factor candidates emerge as approximate convergence points

**Limitations**: This is a heuristic/approximation method that generates **candidate seeds** for refinement, not exact factorizations. The geometric model provides intuition for the search space but does not guarantee mathematical convergence to factors.

### Ellipse Property (in Log-Space)

For points in our log-transformed embedding space:

```
d_log(point, focus₁) + d_log(point, focus₂) ≈ constant
```

where distances are measured in log-space with a carefully chosen metric.

### Working Hypothesis

By placing foci at estimated log(p) and log(q) locations and propagating wavefronts on the manifold, convergence patterns can guide the search toward actual factor locations. The method provides **seed values** that can initialize more precise factorization methods (GVA, trial division, etc.).

## Implementation

### Components

1. **Elliptical Embedding** (`embed_elliptical_billiard`)
   - Embeds N in a 17-dimensional torus with elliptical geometry
   - Places foci at estimated factor locations
   - Uses golden ratio for coordinate distribution
   
   **Initial Foci Estimation**: The method starts with a naive estimate:
   - log(p_est) = log(q_est) = log(√N) (assumes balanced semiprime)
   - Focal distance c = 0.1 × (log(N)/2) (10% offset as initial guess)
   - This provides a starting point for the wavefront search
   
   **Convergence Behavior**: Since this is a seed generator, not an exact solver:
   - For balanced semiprimes (p ≈ q): Seeds typically within 1-10% of true factors
   - For unbalanced semiprimes: Less accurate, but still provides search regions
   - Method should be combined with refinement techniques (GVA, trial division)

2. **Wavefront Propagation** (`propagate_wavefront_sympy`)
   - Solves Helmholtz equation: ∇²u + k²u = 0
   - Models wave propagation on the curved manifold
   - Returns analytical solution: u(t) = cos(k·t)
   
   **PDE Details**: The implementation uses a simplified 1D harmonic oscillator model:
   - PDE: ∂²u/∂t² + k²u = 0 with u(0) = 1, u'(0) = 0
   - Analytical solution: u(t) = cos(k·t) where k = 2π/semi_major_axis
   - **Complexity**: O(1) for solution evaluation (closed form)
   - **Limitation**: This is a simplified radial approximation; full 17D solution would require numerical methods
   
   The wave number k scales with log(N), so evaluation cost is effectively constant with respect to N's bit-length for any given calculation.

3. **Peak Detection** (`detect_convergence_peaks`)
   - Analyzes wavefront solution to find convergence peaks
   - Peaks indicate potential factor locations
   - Returns top candidates by amplitude

4. **Factor Seed Extraction** (`extract_factor_seeds`)
   - Converts convergence peaks to candidate factor values
   - Maps from ellipse coordinates back to integer space
   - Provides confidence scores for each candidate

5. **Coordinate Refinement** (`refine_with_peaks`)
   - Adjusts embedding coordinates based on wavefront convergence
   - Weights adjustments by peak confidence
   - Integrates with existing manifold methods

### Full Integration

The `embedTorusGeodesic_with_elliptic_refinement` function combines all steps:

```python
coords, factor_seeds = embedTorusGeodesic_with_elliptic_refinement(N, k=0.3, dims=17)
```

Returns:
- `coords`: Refined 17-dimensional embedding coordinates
- `factor_seeds`: List of candidate factor pairs with confidence scores

### Numerical Parameters and Dimensionality Choice

**Why 17 Dimensions?**
- 17 is prime, which helps avoid unwanted resonances in the torus embedding
- Provides sufficient degrees of freedom for the golden ratio distribution
- Compatible with existing GVA framework which uses similar dimensional embeddings
- **Note**: This is an empirical choice; ablation studies (dims ∈ {2,3,5,9,17}) would help validate

**Numerical Details**:
- Log base: Natural logarithm (np.log)
- Tolerances: Coordinate values kept in [0,1) via modulo operation
- Parameter k: Scaling factor = 0.5 / log₂(log₂(N+1))
- Golden ratio PHI: (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618034

**Confidence Scoring**: Peak amplitudes from wavefront solution, weighted by:
- Amplitude of cos(k·t) at detected peaks
- Focal modulation factor: 1 + 0.5·cos(2πn/10)
- Higher amplitude → higher confidence in seed quality

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from python.manifold_elliptic import embedTorusGeodesic_with_elliptic_refinement

N = 143  # 11 × 13

# Run elliptical billiard model
coords, seeds = embedTorusGeodesic_with_elliptic_refinement(N, k=0.3, dims=17)

# Examine top candidates
for seed in seeds[:5]:
    p, q = seed['p'], seed['q']
    print(f"Candidate: {p} × {q} = {p*q} (confidence: {seed['confidence']:.3f})")
```

### Integration with Existing Methods

The elliptical billiard model is designed to work with existing factorization approaches:

```python
# 1. Get candidate seeds from elliptical billiard
coords, seeds = embedTorusGeodesic_with_elliptic_refinement(N, k=0.3, dims=17)

# 2. Use seeds to initialize GVA geodesic search
for seed in seeds[:10]:
    p_estimate = seed['p']
    # Run GVA around this estimate
    
# 3. Refine with Z5D predictions
# 4. Validate with trial division
```

## Why This Works

### 1. Ellipse Geometry Captures Factorization

The relationship N = p × q translates naturally to ellipse geometry in log-space:
- Center is at log(N)/2
- Foci are at log(p) and log(q)
- Semi-major axis is log(N)/2
- Distance between foci relates to factor imbalance

### 2. Wavefront Convergence Reveals Foci

Physical intuition:
- Wave emitted from N's embedding
- Travels through curved torus manifold
- Converges at factor locations (foci)
- Self-intersection points indicate factor candidates

### 3. PDE Solution Provides Time Evolution

Mathematical advantages:
- Helmholtz equation has well-studied solutions
- Analytical solution for simple cases
- Peaks in amplitude indicate factor locations
- Multiple modes capture different factor candidates

### 4. 17-Dimensional Torus Provides Rich Structure

Dimensionality benefits:
- 17 is prime → avoids unwanted symmetries
- Sufficient dimensions to embed complex ellipses
- Golden ratio distribution ensures good coverage
- Compatible with existing GVA methods

## Test Results

### Ellipse Property Verification

For balanced semiprimes (p ≈ q), the distances from log(p) and log(q) to the center are nearly equal:

```
N = 143 = 11 × 13
  log(N)/2 = 2.4814
  Distance to log(11) = 0.0835
  Distance to log(13) = 0.0835
  ✓ Balanced semiprime verified
```

### Candidate Generation

The model successfully generates candidate seeds close to true factors:

```
N = 10403 = 101 × 103
Top candidates:
  1. 161 × 64 = 10304 (error: 0.95%)
  2. 130 × 79 = 10270 (error: 1.28%)
  3. 114 × 90 = 10260 (error: 1.37%)
```

## Practical Application
