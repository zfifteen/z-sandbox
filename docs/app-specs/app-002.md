# App-002: 256-bit Geometric Factorization Focus

## Sole Focus
The primary and only objective of this application specification is to achieve a success rate greater than 0% in the geometric factorization of 256-bit RSA-style semiprimes. These semiprimes are the product of two balanced 128-bit primes.

## Success Criteria
- Demonstrate at least one successful factorization using the Geodesic Validation Assault (GVA) method.
- Achieve this within a reasonable number of attempts, resulting in a success rate > 0%.

## Background
Building on previous successes at lower bit levels (64-bit at 12%, 128-bit at 3%), the focus is now exclusively on breaking the 256-bit barrier.

## Implementation Notes
- Utilize curved manifold frameworks and A* pathfinding for optimization.
- Incorporate ultra-high precision arithmetic.
- Track progress and metrics to validate improvements.

This specification supersedes any prior focuses and directs all efforts toward this singular goal.
