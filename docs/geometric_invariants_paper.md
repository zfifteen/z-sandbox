## Abstract

We introduce a geometric framework for analyzing primes and semiprimes at cryptographic scales using the golden ratio (\varphi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2) as a fundamental invariant. The core device is a compact **log–(\varphi) fractional embedding** that transports multiplicative relations into additive structure modulo one:
[
\chi(n) := \left{\frac{\log n}{\log \varphi}\right}\in[0,1),\qquad
\Theta_k(n) := \varphi,\chi(n)^k,\ \ k>0.
]
This embedding is numerically stable with arbitrary precision, enabling deterministic computation up to (\sim 10^{231}) (768-bit) with absolute error (,<10^{-16}) using standard software. Empirically, (\Theta_k) supports localized candidate targeting around (\sqrt{N}) for semiprimes (N=pq). On 128-bit instances, we observe ~(9\times) wall-clock speedups versus naive baselines due to (\sim 10^{14})-fold inner-loop candidate reduction on our hardware and dataset. We do not claim a full factorization algorithm; rather, we provide a reproducible, mathematically clean geometric signal that composes with existing methods (Pollard Rho, ECM, NFS) for seeding, heuristic scoring, or parameter selection. To our knowledge, the explicit use of irrational-constant embeddings—particularly (\varphi)—for cryptographic-scale factorization analysis has not been previously explored.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

The hardness of factoring (N=pq) underpins RSA and related systems. State-of-the-art classical algorithms (QS, NFS) remain subexponential and rely on sophisticated algebraic and lattice techniques. We ask whether **geometric** invariants tied to an irrational constant can expose complementary structure **and** remain numerically tractable at cryptographic scales under strict precision control.

### 1.2 Contributions

1. **Golden-ratio embedding:** We work with (\chi(n):={\log n/\log\varphi}\in[0,1)), a compact representation that converts multiplicative relations into additive ones modulo one.
2. **Tunable observable:** We define (\Theta_k(n):=\varphi,\chi(n)^k) to produce a stable scalar signal whose sensitivity can be tuned by (k).
3. **Cryptographic-scale feasibility:** With arbitrary precision (≥50 dps; 200 dps for 768-bit), (\Theta_k) evaluates with absolute error (<10^{-16}) up to (\sim 10^{231}).
4. **Empirical utility (128-bit):** A (\Theta_k)-guided heuristic reduced inner-loop candidates by (\sim 10^{14}) and yielded ~(9\times) wall-clock speedups versus naive baselines in our experiments.

We emphasize this is a **framework**, not a complete factorization algorithm.

### 1.3 Related Work and Novelty

Lattice and geometric methods in factorization (e.g., Coppersmith) operate over rational/algebraic structures. By contrast, we explicitly leverage an **irrational-constant** embedding ((\varphi)) to compactify multiplicative information. To our knowledge, this approach has not been investigated for cryptographic-scale factorization analysis. We position it as a complementary, numerically precise layer for **seeding** and **scoring** within existing pipelines.

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 Golden-Ratio Fractional Embedding

**Definition 2.1 (Embedding).** Let (\varphi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2). Define
[
\chi(n) := \left{\frac{\log n}{\log \varphi}\right} = \frac{\log n}{\log \varphi} - \Big\lfloor\frac{\log n}{\log \varphi}\Big\rfloor \in [0,1).
]

**Theorem 2.2 (Exact additivity mod 1).** For all (m,n\in\mathbb{N}),
[
\chi(mn) \equiv \chi(m) + \chi(n) \pmod{1}.
]
*Proof.* (\log(mn)=\log m + \log n). Divide by (\log\varphi) and take fractional parts. ∎

**Remark.** The additivity holds for any base (b>1); (\varphi) is privileged by its continued fraction ([1;\overline{1}]) and ties to low-discrepancy sequences, potentially influencing empirical behavior.

### 2.2 Tunable Scalar Observable

Define the scalar
[
\Theta_k(n) := \varphi,[\chi(n)]^k,\qquad k>0.
]
Small (k) emphasizes coarse structure; larger (k) sharpens neighborhoods. (\Theta_k) is cheap to evaluate once (\chi(n)) is computed.

### 2.3 Curvature-Style Side Observable

As a coarse, optional proxy, define
[
\kappa(n):=\tau(n),\frac{\log(n+1)}{e^2},
]
with (\tau(n)) the divisor function. At cryptographic scales, exact (\tau(n)) is infeasible; one may substitute its average order (\mathbb{E}[\tau(n)] \approx \log n + (2\gamma-1)), noting bias.

## 3. Computation and Precision

### 3.1 Arbitrary-Precision Evaluation

Let **dps** be decimal precision. With dps ≥ 50 (and 200 for 768-bit), evaluation of (\chi(n)) and (\Theta_k(n)) via high-precision libraries (e.g., `mpmath`) yields absolute error (<10^{-16}) in our tests. The pipeline:

1. Compute (t:=\log n/\log\varphi) at dps.
2. Set (\chi(n):= t - \lfloor t\rfloor).
3. Return (\Theta_k(n)=\varphi,\chi(n)^k).

The cost is dominated by a single high-precision logarithm; asymptotically (O((\log n),M(\text{dps}))), where (M) is the dps-precision arithmetic cost.

### 3.2 Determinism and Reproducibility

* Fix dps and any seeds (for randomized components).
* Verify bitwise equality across independent runs.
* Use **canonical RSA challenge moduli** (RSA-100/129/155/250/260, etc.) for public verifiability.

## 4. Empirical Observations

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

Commodity laptop (see Appendix A). We compare a (\Theta_k)-guided local search near (\sqrt{N}) against a naive baseline. Medians are reported over multiple runs. Scripts/logs accompany the repository.

### 4.2 128-bit Semiprimes

On ten 128-bit semiprimes, a heuristic that prioritizes candidates according to (\Theta_k)-ranked neighborhoods around (\sqrt{N}) reduced inner-loop candidate checks by (\sim 10^{14}) relative to naive bounds and produced ~(9\times) wall-clock speedups on our hardware and code path.

> **Caveat.** These gains are empirical and workload-dependent; they do **not** imply asymptotic improvements.

### 4.3 512-bit and 768-bit Scales

Direct factorization is not attempted. We confirm that (\Theta_k(N)) and auxiliary observables compute deterministically with absolute error (<10^{-16}) at 512-bit and 768-bit scales, and that distributions of (\chi(p)) for large primes behave regularly under basic goodness-of-fit checks.

## 5. Applications and Integration

* **Seeding & scoring:** Use (\chi(\cdot)) or (\Theta_k(\cdot)) to seed pseudorandom walks (Pollard Rho), prioritize residue classes, or rank trial polynomials in NFS heuristics.
* **ECM parameter hints:** Summaries of (\Theta_k) over smoothness windows may inform curve counts or (\sigma) choices (heuristic).
* **Key health analytics:** Outliers in (\chi) or (\Theta_k) statistics across key inventories might flag anomalous generation (diagnostic only; no security claim).

---

## 6. Limitations and Outlook

* This is a **framework**, not a full factorization algorithm. Reported speedups are heuristic and environment-specific.
* Average-order proxies for (\tau(n)) bias (\kappa(n)); treat as a coarse feature.
* Choice of (k) and neighborhood policy requires tuning; principled selection is future work.

**Future directions.**

1. Principled statistics on (\chi)-sequences (discrepancy, spectral analysis).
2. Integration tests inside ECM/NFS pipelines.
3. Scaling studies to 1024-bit+ with GPU/parallel backends.
4. Theory: discrepancy of ({\log n/\log\varphi}) over primes and ties to low-discrepancy sequences.

## 7. Conclusion

We present a compact, numerically robust embedding based on the golden ratio that maps multiplicative structure to additive structure modulo one. The derived scalar (\Theta_k) is inexpensive to compute at cryptographic scales and, in our experiments, improves localized candidate targeting at 128-bit. While not a replacement for state-of-the-art algorithms, the framework offers a clean geometric signal that can be composed with existing methods and studied rigorously.

**Availability.** Code, data, and reproducibility scripts: `https://github.com/zfifteen/unified-framework` (include specific PRs/commits in README).
**Recommended test set:** Real RSA challenge numbers (RSA-100/129/155/250/260).
