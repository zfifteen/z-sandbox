# Elliptical Billiard Model - Quick Start Guide

## What is it?

A novel approach to integer factorization based on **wavefront propagation on a curved manifold**. It models the factorization problem N = p × q as an ellipse in log-space, where factors emerge as convergence points of self-interfering wavefronts.

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Usage

```python
from python.manifold_elliptic import embedTorusGeodesic_with_elliptic_refinement

# Factor a semiprime
N = 143  # 11 × 13

# Get candidate factor seeds
coords, seeds = embedTorusGeodesic_with_elliptic_refinement(N, k=0.3, dims=17)

# Examine top candidates
for seed in seeds[:5]:
    p, q = seed['p'], seed['q']
    print(f"{p} × {q} = {p*q} (confidence: {seed['confidence']:.3f})")
```

### 2. Run Tests

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite (7 tests)
python3 tests/test_elliptic_billiard.py

# Expected output: ✓ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

### 3. Run Demo

```bash
# See the model in action
python3 python/examples/elliptic_billiard_demo.py

# See integration with GVA
python3 python/examples/elliptic_integration_example.py
```

## Mathematical Foundation

### The Core Insight

For semiprime N = p × q:
```
log(N) = log(p) + log(q)
```

In log-space, N is the "sum" of two foci at log(p) and log(q).

### Ellipse Property

Points on an ellipse have constant sum of distances to foci:
```
d(point, focus₁) + d(point, focus₂) = 2a  (constant)
```

### Wavefront Convergence

1. Embed N in 17-dimensional torus with elliptical geometry
2. Propagate wavefront using Helmholtz equation: ∇²u + k²u = 0
3. Detect convergence peaks (self-interference patterns)
4. Extract factor candidates from peaks

## Example Results

### Test Case: N = 143 (11 × 13)

```
Ellipse property: ✓ Verified (log-space relationship holds)
Generated 10 candidate seeds
Top candidates:
  1. 15 × 9 = 135   (error: 5.6%, confidence: 1.500)
  2. 13 × 10 = 130  (error: 9.1%, confidence: 1.155)
  3. 12 × 11 = 132  (error: 7.7%, confidence: 1.155)
```

### Test Case: N = 10403 (101 × 103)

```
Top candidates:
  1. 161 × 64 = 10304  (error: 0.95%, confidence: 1.500)
  2. 130 × 79 = 10270  (error: 1.28%, confidence: 1.500)
  3. 114 × 90 = 10260  (error: 1.37%, confidence: 1.145)
```

## Integration with GVA

The elliptical billiard model generates **candidate seeds** that can initialize other factorization methods:

```python
# 1. Get seeds from elliptical billiard
coords, seeds = embedTorusGeodesic_with_elliptic_refinement(N, k=0.3, dims=17)

# 2. Use seeds to guide GVA search
for seed in seeds[:10]:
    p_estimate = seed['p']
    # Run GVA geodesic search around p_estimate
    # Refine with Z5D predictions
    # Validate with trial division
```

## When to Use

### Best For:
- Balanced semiprimes (p ≈ q)
- Generating initial candidate guesses
- Multi-stage factorization pipelines
- Research and experimentation

### Limitations:
- Generates approximations, not exact factors
- Requires additional refinement/validation
- Best combined with other methods

## Performance

- **Embedding**: O(dims) = O(17) operations
- **Wavefront**: O(1) analytical solution
- **Peak detection**: O(peaks) = O(20) samples
- **Extraction**: O(peaks) = O(10) candidates

Total: Very fast - milliseconds for small N

## Theoretical Background

This implementation is based on modeling factorization as a **wave propagation problem on a curved manifold**, where:

- Factor locations emerge as **convergence points** of wavefronts
- Self-interference patterns reveal **geometric structure**
- Ellipse property captures **log-space relationships**
- 17-dimensional torus avoids **symmetry artifacts**
