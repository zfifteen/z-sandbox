## Summary Table
| Epsilon (Îµ) | Success Rate (95% CI) | Avg Divisions Until Success | Efficiency Gain |
|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| 0.02       | 19.6% (16.4-23.3)    | 45.3                       | 3.7x faster    |
| 0.03       | 27.2% (23.5-31.3)    | 65.8                       | 2.6x faster    |
| 0.04       | 32.8% (28.8-37.0)    | 84.5                       | 2.0x faster    |
| 0.05       | 39.8% (35.6-44.2)    | 103.0                      | 1.6x faster    |

## Key Insights
- Higher success rates in balanced mode compared to unbalanced.
- Geometric method reduces candidates significantly: 30.3 - 72.8 avg vs ~168 for naive.
- Computational savings: 56% - 81% reduction in candidates.
- Per-pass breakdown shows most successes in first pass (k=0.200).

This run demonstrates the effectiveness of the multi-pass geometric heuristic in the C/MPFR implementation for balanced semiprimes.
