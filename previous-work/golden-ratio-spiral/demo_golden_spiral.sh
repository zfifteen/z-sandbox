# Golden Ratio Index Scaling and Spiral Search - Demonstration Script
# ====================================================================
#
# This script demonstrates the Golden Ratio Index Scaling and Spiral Search
# implementation capabilities through progressive tests showing empirical
# validation and mathematical structure.
#
# Features demonstrated:
# - Golden ratio scaling (œÜ ‚âà 1.618) for super-exponential growth prediction  
# - Golden angle spiral search (137.5¬∞) for optimal packing
# - MPFR high-precision arithmetic throughout
# - Minimized resonance gaps in dense prime fields
#
# Author: Golden Ratio Spiral Implementation Team
# Date: Generated for Golden Ratio Spiral implementation
